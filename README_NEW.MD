I have updated my development environment to a docker container running Ubuntu 22.04, with my usual 
suite of ML / Data ;ibraries pre-installed. I plan on adding jupyter notebook support in the future, as well as
the JAX library.

In addition, I need to figure out what, if anything, needs to stay consistent in a ML Docker project lifecycle.

A Snapshot from inside the Ubuntu Machine detailing some preinstalled libraries, including PyTorch and Transformers:
