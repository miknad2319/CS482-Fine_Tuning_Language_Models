# CS482-Fine_Tuning_Language_Models

I elected to use an Anaconda Virtual Environment, although that decision will likely change in the near future.

If you don't have Anaconda installed you can download it from here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html

With Anaconda installed, we then make a new conda environment using the command "conda create --name your_env_name"

https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

We then intall the following packages:  

-----PyTorch
   
-----Transformers
  
I already have PyTorch installed, but to download PyTorch into your Conda virtual environment activate your 
virtual environment using the command "conda activate your_env_name"

then run the command "conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch"

For Transformers you can use the command "conda install -c conda-forge transformers" (REMEMBER TO
INSTALL PACKAGES IN YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT ONLY)

I did not have Transformers installed yet, so below is a screenshot of me downloading and installing
the package into my Conda Virtual Environment called "base"

Below are screenshots that confirm PyTorch and Transformers are installed in the Conda environment "base"
